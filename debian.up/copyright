This is the Ubuntu prepackaged version of the Linux kernel, with
added UP board support.
Linux was written by Linus Torvalds <Linus.Torvalds@cs.Helsinki.FI>
and others.

The base kernel was put together by the Ubuntu Kernel Team, from
sources retrieved from upstream linux git.
The sources may be found at most Linux ftp sites, including 
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/

Patches have then been added by Emutex (http://emutex.com) to enable specific
features of the UP board (http://up-board.org).

This package is currently maintained by the
ubilinux team <ubilinux@emutex.com>
